In this project we're only supposed to create a program to make the user play the "Rock, Paper, Scissors" game against a computer.
it'll be a game that consist of five rounds and each round the program shows us the winner and the cumulated score.
at the end of the game, we'll show the final score the player and tell them whether they won or lost the game.
